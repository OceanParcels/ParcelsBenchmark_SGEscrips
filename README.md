# Parcels Benchmark - SGE scripts
The repository holds the Bourne-shell (bash) scripts for starting up the benchmark simulations with Parcels on a Sungrid SGE cluster (e.g. UU-science's GEMINI cluster).

**_IMPORTANT_**: please adapt the shell-scripts (*.sh-files) about their paths and the responding mail address according to you own cluster setup - just cloning the repository and running the job is going to fail for your cluster without adapting those configurations!
